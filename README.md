# Numbers Classification

## Description

This program classifies a list of integers into four categories based on their properties: even/odd and positive/negative. 
It uses a simple conditional logic to determine the classification of each number in the list. 

## Explanation

- Even/Odd logic of this code is to determine whether a number is even or odd by using the bitwise AND operation with the value 1. 
  In binary representation, even numbers always have a least significant bit of 0, while odd numbers have a least significant bit of 1. 
  Therefore, when an even number is ANDed with 1, the result is 0 (indicating evenness), and when an odd number is ANDed with 1, the result is 1 (indicating oddness).

- Positive/Negative Logic is by checking if the Number Is bigger than or less than Zero
